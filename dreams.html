 <h2 style="font-style: oblique; font-family: courier new" > I wrote a post about my dreams that I came up with. In it, I tried to concentrate on those priorities that I felt could help someone. I wanted it to stay somewhat impersonal, a list for someone else out there searching for motivation relevant to life goals. Although it was intended for others, however, compiling it eventually made me think of my dreams in life too! I figured putting together a related piece could be interesting. This time, my personal ambitions, my dreams and the goals I have for my life are detailed.In glorifying the life of a person and making life hopeful every day the word dream is infinite. Each person has our own dream, which he thinks one day will come true and miraculously make his life fanciful. There are dreams like stars. You know you're never able to meet or feel the stars. But you still believe that they will be touched by you.  </h2>

<h4 style="font-style: oblique; font-family: courier new" >I have many dreams in my life, when I was a little i used to be a doctor. I love to be a doctor because for me doctor got so much money. But now, I have no ambition, I just have  a dream. My dream is want to be a useful person for my parents. I want to make them happy and bring them to Makkah, this is their dream. I want to study hard, so that I can get a good job in future. Besides that, I love to travel. My top 3 dream places are Maldives, Japan and Dubai. I hope all my dream will be achieved one day, I want to bring my family and friends with me.

<h4 style="font-style: oblique; font-family: courier new" >The first step we need to take to convert our dreams into reality is determination. In many aspects, it will support you. Determination will help us set the course of action and assist us to plan something for the journey. In addition, it will assist us to steady our pace towards a dream. My dream, however big, is that short-term goals will always be saved. This is extremely important because it will not help us get closer to our dream by making hasty decisions. Some dreams take time to nurture, some require procedures to follow, without which our dream can not be accomplished. In life, we may dream big, but we must set long and short-term goals to achieve them. These goals will make us steady, taking a step at a time, without jumping into everything at once in haste. I aspire to become a successful women so that I can do everything and achieve what I want. &#127775;</h4>
