  <li><a style="font-family: courier new;" >Assalamualaikum w.b.t, this is me Nur Arrisya Binti Azman. I am 22 years old. Next month I will graduate with my Diploma in Information Management. I am a dedicated person with a family of six. I enjoy reading and the knowledge and perspective that my reading gives me has strengthened my information skills and presentation abilities. I have been successful at raising a family, and I attribute this success to my ability to plan, schedule, and handle many different tasks at once. In the classroom, where there are several different personalities and learning styles, this versatility would benefit me. People find me an upbeat, self-motivated team with exceptional communication skills. I may tell that I am a hard-working and conscientious student. In addition, as a sociable person, because I like to connect with people and get to know interesting new people, I have several friends. It's fun to learn, the students are very polite and willing to support. I enjoy my time at university. The environment can't help but make me really want to go there. I like to take on difficult roles and deal with them. I'm a very passionate student and I think this is my strong point.</a> </li>

<li></<p> I love to eat and go out with my friends. Besides that, I was so obsessed with Shawn Mendes and Cristiano Ronaldo. They gave me more inspiration especially Shawn Mendes, his songs are too good to described. Almost everyday i listen to his songs. For Ronaldo, I like him since I was 11 years old. I love when he playing football and I also love his humble attitude. I'm a nice girl and an interesting girl with a good sense of humor, my friends claim. I feel incredibly relaxed with them as soon as I encounter new people who are pleased to meet me. I conclude that one of the most significant qualities of human life is friendship. We share new ideas, find several fascinating things and learn new things about each other. I respect friendship and the people that surround me.</p> </li>

<li></<p>The purpose I'm currently working for is to make this planet a better place to live by beginning with myself to make the improvements. Sure, I have had bad experiences in my life, but that's exactly what made me the way I am now: thankful, full of love, with a desire to study well, because in the future it will enable me to become a good person and have a high quality of life. I believe that day by day it manifests and I feel much more responsible for what I do and where I go. I know that I'm on the right road for what I already have and I will do my utmost to encourage others to live the way they feel like living as well. </p> </li>
